/*
 * MintRIVA - chunky-to-planar (C2P) for the AGA path.
 *
 * WritePixelArray8 works but carries general-case overhead (temp RastPort,
 * clipping). This is a specialised C2P that writes 8-bit chunky straight into a
 * screen's bitplanes via an 8x8 bit transpose (host-verified correct). It is
 * the portable-C stand-in for RiVA's hand-tuned RendererAGAC2P.i; a later asm
 * pass can replace the transpose hot loop.
 *
 * Constraints: x0 and the processed width must be multiples of 8 (byte
 * aligned). The caller pads the chunky buffer and aligns x0.
